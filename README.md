# Wine Quality Prediction Project

This project analyzes and predicts wine quality using machine learning techniques. The dataset used is `winequality-red.csv`.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone or download the repository.**
2. Place the `winequality-red.csv` file in the project root directory.
3. Install the required Python libraries (see below).

## Required Libraries

Make sure to install the following libraries before running the code:

- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- xgboost

You can install them using pip:

```powershell
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib xgboost
```

## Recommended Versions
